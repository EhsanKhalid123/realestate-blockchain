# Blockchain Real-estate App

A proof-of-concept real-estate management application secured with a Proof by Authority Blockchain. Demonstrates a
possible use-case of blockchain to secure the full real-estate lifecycle, from seller to buyer, to bank.

This application was built as an extension project for the class `Security in Computing & IT (COSC2536)` offered by RMIT
in Semester 1, 2021.

This project will be open-sourced on the 15th of May 2021.

### Limitations:

- No secure way to distribute keys (possible with a conventional DB and login system)
- Limited P2P network protocol (max 10 clients, with more leading to slow connection speeds)
- PDF files are not distributed on the network (too large). Could be signed and distributed through conventional means.
